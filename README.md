Simple bookstore program shows books included to constructor. You can add your new books into H2 database but Java program has a validation rules
that only books written by author which name or surname starts from letter "A" or "a" are acceptable. Naturally web application includes
a few additional functionalities such as update book and delete book. Update book has the same validation rule as add book functionality.
Additionally this web app includes two REST methods - add book and get all books.
This program is a sample of my capabilities dated September 2019.
